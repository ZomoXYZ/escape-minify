# Escape and Minify

This is a small webpage that simply allows you to enter your code in on one side, and on the other side will return your code escaped, minified, and both.

## Used files.

Other projects I used for this:

* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
* [KeyMaster](https://github.com/madrobby/keymaster)

## What could this be used for?

* **Escape**
 * Escaping your code allows you to write characters onto your webpage you normally couldn't.
   * i.e. `>`
* **Minify**
 * Very simply this makes your code be a smaller size, so people can download and run your webpage faster.
* **Both**
 * This would be very useful to make smaller XML files
